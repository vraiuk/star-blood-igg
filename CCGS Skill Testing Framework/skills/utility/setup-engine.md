# Skill Test Spec: /setup-engine

## Skill Summary

`/setup-engine` pins the project's engine, version and language. It accepts
`[engine]`, `[engine] [version]`, `refresh`, `upgrade [old] [new]`, or no
argument for guided selection. For Godot it asks which language (GDScript, C#
or Both) before showing the Technology Stack. It then:

- writes the Technology Stack and the `ENGINE-REFERENCE-IMPORT` line to
  `CLAUDE.md` after "May I write these engine settings to `CLAUDE.md`?"
- fills `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` (the legacy mirror: naming
  conventions, specialist routing table, input/platform, performance budgets)
  after the user approves the presented defaults
- dual-writes the `engine`, `specialists`, `naming` and `commands` blocks to
  `project.yaml` — the primary config store — after "May I write the `engine`,
  `specialists`, `naming`, and `commands` blocks to `project.yaml`?"
- updates or creates `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/`, scaffolds
  `project.godot` for Godot (never for Unity or Unreal), and reads everything
  back with `project-coherence.sh`

On a re-run it edits existing `project.yaml` blocks in place rather than
duplicating them. No director gates apply. The verdict is COMPLETE when the
engine is configured.

## Static Assertions (Structural)

Checked against the SKILL.md by `/skill-test spec` — no fixture needed.

- [ ] Has required frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`
- [ ] Has ≥2 phase headings
- [ ] Contains verdict keyword: COMPLETE
- [ ] Contains "May I write" language before writing `CLAUDE.md` and before writing the `project.yaml` blocks
- [ ] Has a next-step handoff (Section 12 prints one tier-matched Next-Steps list, e.g. `/brainstorm` at `minimal`)

---

## Director Gate Checks

None. `/setup-engine` is a technical configuration skill. No director gates apply.

## Test Cases

### Case 1: Godot 4 + GDScript — Full engine configuration

**Fixture:**
- `project.yaml` has no `engine` block; `technical-preferences.md` holds only placeholders
- No `design/gdd/game-concept.md` and no `design/game-brief.md`
- `docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md` already pins 4.6
- No `project.godot` at the repo root; the user approves every write

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot 4.6`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Full-spec mode: Section 2's guided selection is skipped
2. Skill asks the Godot language question (A GDScript / B C# / C Both); user picks GDScript
3. Skill shows the Technology Stack and asks "May I write these engine settings to `CLAUDE.md`?"
4. Technical preferences are presented with GDScript naming (snake_case files and
   variables) and the A3 routing table: `.gd` → godot-gdscript-specialist,
   `.gdshader` → godot-shader-specialist, `.tscn` → godot-specialist
5. Because Section 2 never ran and no design artifact exists, the skill asks
   the project-shape question (2D/3D, web or not) instead of writing
   `Forward+`/`Jolt` from the engine name
6. `commands.build` export preset is asked, never defaulted; `commands.test` is
   the gdUnit4 `GdUnitCmdTool.gd` command
7. Skill asks "May I write the `engine`, `specialists`, `naming`, and `commands` blocks to `project.yaml`?"
8. Section 6 reads its coverage table: 4.6 is beyond the Godot row (~4.3), so
   the knowledge risk is HIGH
9. VERSION.md already pins 4.6 → nothing to regenerate; only its
   `Installed at pin time` row is written, from the Section 3 probe
10. Skill proposes `project.godot` and asks before creating it; verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] `engine.name` is Godot and `engine.language` is GDScript in `project.yaml`
- [ ] `naming.variables` and `naming.files` are `snake_case`
- [ ] Routing table includes `.gd`, `.gdshader`, and `.tscn` entries; `specialists.code` is `godot-gdscript-specialist`
- [ ] The rendering/physics shape is asked, not inferred from the engine name
- [ ] "May I write" is asked before `CLAUDE.md` and before `project.yaml` are written
- [ ] Knowledge Risk is HIGH — the Section 6 table's cutoff is May 2025 and its Godot row ~4.3, as in the shipped VERSION.md
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE

---

### Case 2: Unity + C# — Unity-specific configuration

**Fixture:**
- Placeholders only in `technical-preferences.md`; no `engine` block in `project.yaml`
- The user supplies the version and the build target when asked

**Input:** `/setup-engine unity`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Engine-only mode: version looked up and confirmed with the user
2. No language question (Unity is C#); CLAUDE.md Language is `C#`
3. Naming: PascalCase classes/methods, `_camelCase` private fields
4. Routing: `.cs` → unity-specialist, `.shader`/`.shadergraph` → unity-shader-specialist,
   `.unity`/`.prefab` → unity-specialist, `.uxml`/`.uss` → unity-ui-specialist
5. `rendering: URP`, `physics: PhysX` written directly — no shape question
6. `commands.build` target is asked (no hardcoded `StandaloneLinux64`);
   `naming.constants` carries the `# UNVERIFIED` comment
7. No Unity project is scaffolded; the user is told to create it in Unity Hub

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Engine field is set to Unity and Language to C#
- [ ] Naming conventions reflect C# conventions
- [ ] Routing table includes `.cs` and `.unity` entries
- [ ] No project-shape question is asked for Unity
- [ ] No Unity project files are written
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE

---

### Case 3: Unreal — C++ primary, Blueprint routed to its specialist

**Fixture:**
- Placeholders only; the user never states that the project is Blueprint-primary
- The session runs on Windows (`uname -s` is neither `Linux` nor `Darwin`), so the Windows `commands` block applies

**Input:** `/setup-engine unreal 5.7`

**Expected behavior:**
1. The primary-language question defaults to C++, so CLAUDE.md Language reads
   `C++ (primary), Blueprint (gameplay prototyping)` — the line follows the
   answer, and a Blueprint-primary answer would write
   `Blueprint (primary), C++ where needed`
2. `project.yaml` gets `engine.language: "C++"` (Blueprint only when the project is Blueprint-primary)
3. Routing: `.uasset` BP classes → ue-blueprint-specialist; `.umap`/`.uasset` → unreal-specialist;
   `specialists.additional` includes ue-blueprint-specialist
4. `commands` are written as single-quoted scalars under a
   `# TODO: confirm these` comment; `engine.path` is recorded
5. Performance budgets are asked via `AskUserQuestion` (set defaults / leave
   `[TO BE CONFIGURED]`), not pre-filled
6. No `.uproject` is scaffolded; verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Engine field is set to Unreal Engine 5.7 and `engine.language` is `C++`
- [ ] Routing table includes `.uasset` and `.umap` entries
- [ ] ue-blueprint-specialist is assigned for Blueprint graphs
- [ ] `commands` carry the `# TODO: confirm these` comment
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE

---

### Case 4: Re-run on a Configured Project — blocks edited in place

**Fixture:**
- `project.yaml` already has `engine` (Godot 4.6), `specialists`, `naming`, a
  `modes` block, and a `commands` block missing its `smoke` key
- `project.godot` exists at the repo root
- `docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md` pins 4.6

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot 4.6`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill reads `project.yaml` before editing it
2. Each existing block is edited in place; `commands.smoke` is added to the
   partial block; no second copy of any block is appended
3. `modes` and every other non-engine block are preserved untouched
4. The existing `project.godot` is not overwritten — the skill says so and skips
5. VERSION.md pins the same version → nothing to regenerate: Engine Version,
   Project Pinned and Last Docs Verified are left as they are, and only the
   `Installed at pin time` row is written with the Section 3 probe result
6. Verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] No block is duplicated in `project.yaml`, and the missing `commands.smoke` key is added
- [ ] `modes` (and all other non-engine content) is unchanged
- [ ] `project.godot` is not overwritten
- [ ] For a same-version pin, Engine Version, Project Pinned and Last Docs Verified are untouched and `Installed at pin time` is written
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE

---

### Case 5: Director Gate Check — No gate; setup-engine is a utility skill

**Fixture:**
- Fresh project with no engine configured

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill completes full engine configuration
2. No director agents are spawned at any point
3. No gate IDs appear in output

**Assertions:**
- [ ] No director gate is invoked
- [ ] No gate skip messages appear
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE without any gate check

---

### Case 6: Installed Editor Older Than the Chosen Version — ask, then record

**Fixture:**
- As Case 1; `docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md` pins 4.6
- `godot --version` reports `4.5.1.stable`
- The user picks "pin the newer one and upgrade later"

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot 4.6`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Section 3 probes the installed editor and finds 4.5.1 — a mismatch
2. Skill states both versions and asks, offering three options: pin the
   installed version, pin the newer one and upgrade later, or pin the newer one
   deliberately
3. The answer is recorded; the skill does not pick for the user
4. VERSION.md already pins 4.6, so nothing is regenerated, but its
   `Installed at pin time` row is written with 4.5.1
5. Verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Both versions are stated and all three options are offered
- [ ] The skill waits for the user's choice rather than picking silently
- [ ] `Installed at pin time` records 4.5.1 — the same-version branch does not skip it
- [ ] Engine Version, Project Pinned and Last Docs Verified are not restamped

---

### Case 7: Godot not on PATH — the probed executable goes into `commands.*`

**Fixture:**
- As Case 1, on Windows; `godot --version` fails — `godot` is not on `PATH`
- The probe finds `C:/Program Files/Godot/Godot_v4.6.1-stable_win64.exe`, which reports `4.6.1.stable`
- The user names the export preset `Windows Desktop`

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot 4.6`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Section 3 reads the version from the executable it found — it does not report "no engine installed"
2. `build`, `test`, `run` and `smoke` each start with the quoted full path, as single-quoted scalars; `build` quotes its preset with double quotes:
   `build: '"C:/Program Files/Godot/Godot_v4.6.1-stable_win64.exe" --headless --export-debug "Windows Desktop"'`
3. `test` keeps `--remote-debug tcp://127.0.0.1:0` and the gdUnit4 runner arguments after the path
4. `engine.path` records the executable
5. Verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] No `commands.*` value names bare `godot`
- [ ] Every Godot command value is a single-quoted scalar and none holds both quote types
- [ ] `engine.path` records the editor executable
- [ ] Variant — the probe finds nothing and the user does not know where Godot is: bare `godot` is kept under a `# TODO: godot is not on PATH here` comment, and the skill says the commands will not run until the path is set

---

## Protocol Compliance

- [ ] Presents draft configuration before asking to write
- [ ] Asks "May I write" before writing `CLAUDE.md` and the `project.yaml` blocks; technical preferences are written only after the user approves the presented defaults
- [ ] Respects engine argument when provided (skips guided selection)
- [ ] Dual-writes `project.yaml` and `technical-preferences.md`, then reads `project.yaml` back to confirm they agree
- [ ] On re-run, edits existing `project.yaml` blocks in place without duplicating them
- [ ] Writes the probed editor path into `commands.*` — for Unity always, for Godot whenever `godot` is not on `PATH` — never a bare executable that does not resolve
- [ ] Never defaults the Godot export preset or the Unity build target — asks for it; Unreal's `commands` are best-effort values matched to the machine's OS (`-platform=Win64` on Windows, `Linux` on Linux) under a `# TODO` comment; on macOS only `build` is written, and `test`, `run` and `smoke` stay TODO lines
- [ ] Writes the Section 3 probe into VERSION.md's `Installed at pin time` row whatever the outcome, after asking "May I record `Installed at pin time: …` in `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`?"
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE after configuration is written

## Coverage Notes

- Godot C# and Both follow Case 1 with the A1/A2/A3 variants from
  `references/godot-language-config.md`; not separately tested.
- The `refresh` and `upgrade` subcommands (Sections 10–11) are not tested here.
- The Unreal Linux and macOS `commands` blocks (chosen by `uname -s`) are not
  fixture-tested; Case 3 pins Windows.
- Section 6 is a lookup against the skill's own coverage table, asserted in
  Case 1. The Section 7 reference docs for a version with no reference set yet
  depend on WebSearch results; not assertion-tested.
- A probe that cannot run reports `installed version NOT DETERMINED` — never
  "no engine installed"; not separately tested.
- A Blueprint-primary Unreal answer (`engine.language: "Blueprint"`) follows
  Case 3 with the other Language line; not separately tested.
