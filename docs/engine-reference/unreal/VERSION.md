# Unreal Engine — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Engine Version** | Unreal Engine 5.7 |
| **Installed at pin time** | NOT DETERMINED — `/setup-engine` §3 probes the installed editor and records the result here. |
| **Release Date** | November 2025 |
| **Project Pinned** | 2026-02-13 |
| **Last Docs Verified** | 2026-02-13 |
| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |

## Knowledge Gap Warning

The LLM's training data likely covers Unreal Engine up to ~5.3. Versions 5.4, 5.5,
5.6, and 5.7 introduced significant changes that the model does NOT know about.
Always cross-reference this directory before suggesting Unreal API calls.

## Installed-Version Gap Warning

The warning above is one-directional — it covers the **model** knowing less than
this pin. The reverse gap is real and `/setup-engine` §3 creates it deliberately
("pin the newer one and upgrade later"): this reference can sit **ahead of the
installed editor**, and an agent citing it correctly then emits APIs that do not
compile locally. **Check `Installed at pin time` above before trusting a
version-qualified claim** — `NOT DETERMINED` means the gap is unknown, not absent.

## Post-Cutoff Version Timeline

| Version | Release | Risk Level | Key Theme |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| 5.4 | ~Mid 2025 | HIGH | Motion Design tools, animation improvements, PCG enhancements |
| 5.5 | ~Sep 2025 | HIGH | Megalights (millions of lights), animation authoring, MegaCity demo |
| 5.6 | ~Oct 2025 | MEDIUM | Performance optimizations, bug fixes |
| 5.7 | Nov 2025 | HIGH | PCG production-ready, Substrate production-ready, AI assistant |

## Major Changes from UE 5.3 to UE 5.7

### Breaking Changes
- **Substrate Material System**: New material framework (replaces legacy materials)
- **PCG (Procedural Content Generation)**: Production-ready, major API changes
- **Megalights**: New lighting system (millions of dynamic lights)
- **Animation Authoring**: New rigging and animation tools
- **AI Assistant**: In-editor AI guidance (experimental)

### New Features (Post-Cutoff)
- **Megalights**: Dynamic lighting at massive scale (millions of lights)
- **Substrate Materials**: Production-ready modular material system
- **PCG Framework**: Procedural world generation (production-ready in 5.7)
- **Enhanced Virtual Production**: MetaHuman integration, deeper VP workflows
- **Animation Improvements**: Better rigging, blending, procedural animation
- **AI Assistant**: In-editor AI help (experimental)

### Deprecated Systems
- **Legacy Material System**: Migrate to Substrate for new projects
- **Old PCG API**: Use new production-ready PCG API (5.7+)
