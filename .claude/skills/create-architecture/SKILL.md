# Create Architecture

This skill produces `docs/architecture/architecture.md` — the master architecture
document that translates all approved GDDs into a concrete technical blueprint.
It sits between design and implementation, and must exist before sprint planning begins.

**Distinct from `/architecture-decision`**: ADRs record individual point decisions.
This skill creates the whole-system blueprint that gives ADRs their context.


See `.claude/docs/director-gates.md` for the full check pattern. Individual gate definitions live in `.claude/docs/director-gates/[gate-id].md` — the spawned agent reads its own gate file; do not read it in the parent session.


Every `AskUserQuestion` call follows `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative asks always · guided major-only · autonomous logs and proceeds;
`automation_always_ask` categories always prompt).

**`docs.density`** — it controls per-section *depth*, where `workflow`
controls which sections exist. `modes.rigor` sets both together; set
`docs.density` explicitly to vary depth alone: `terse` (the default, via `rigor: minimal`) = layer diagrams + decision bullets,
no essays; `balanced` = diagrams + paragraph explanations of layer choices
(`rigor: standard`); `thorough` = full prose with rationale, trade-offs, and alternatives
considered per layer. Apply it to every section you author.

**`workflow`** (see `.claude/docs/workflow-modes.md`):
- `full` — full architecture: all layers, module ownership, data flow, API
  boundaries, full ADR audit.
- `standard` — simplified: system layer map + critical ADR list only.
- `minimal` — not required. Can still be run voluntarily.

**Argument modes:**
- **No argument / `full`**: Full guided walkthrough — all sections, start to finish
- **`layers`**: Focus on the system layer diagram only
- **`data-flow`**: Focus on data flow between modules only
- **`api-boundaries`**: Focus on API boundary definitions only
- **`adr-audit`**: Audit existing ADRs for engine compatibility gaps only

## Phase 0: Load All Context

Before anything else, load the full project context in this order:

### 0a. Engine Context (Critical)

Read the four project-wide engine documents in full — they are small, and every
part of each is used:

1. `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/VERSION.md`
   → Extract: engine name, version, LLM cutoff, post-cutoff risk levels
2. `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/breaking-changes.md`
   → Extract: all HIGH and MEDIUM risk changes
3. `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/deprecated-apis.md`
   → Extract: APIs to avoid
4. `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/current-best-practices.md`
   → Extract: post-cutoff best practices that differ from training data

Then read **only the module docs whose domain this game actually uses** —
not the whole `modules/` directory:

5. `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/modules/` — glob it to establish what exists,
   then match against the domains present in `design/gdd/systems-index.md`
   (the same domain vocabulary the ADR template uses: Physics, Rendering, UI,
   Audio, Navigation, Animation, Networking, Core, Input). Read the matching
   modules; skip the rest.
   → Extract: current API patterns per domain

   A game with no multiplayer system does not need the networking module loaded
   to write its architecture, and loading it costs the same as one that does.
   **If the domain match is ambiguous, read the module** — a missed engine
   constraint is far more expensive here than a redundant read, because this
   phase is where those constraints get baked into the architecture.

If no engine is configured, stop and prompt:
> "No engine is configured. Run `/setup-engine` first. Architecture cannot be
> written without knowing which engine and version you are targeting."

### 0b. Design Context + Technical Requirements Extraction

Load the approved design documents and extract technical requirements from each:

1. `design/gdd/game-concept.md` — game pillars, genre, core loop
2. `design/gdd/systems-index.md` — all systems, dependencies, priority tiers

**Check both exist before reading either. Neither is optional here, and both
need an absence branch** — §0a stops for an unconfigured engine, and these two
matter just as much:

- **`systems-index.md` absent** — stop:
  > "No systems index found. Run `/map-systems` first. An architecture written
  > without it invents layers for systems nobody mapped, and every ADR, epic and
  > story downstream inherits that invention."
  At `minimal` the index is not required (§ tier note above) — say so and proceed
  from the brief instead.
- **`game-concept.md` absent** — at `standard`/`full`, stop and point at
  `/brainstorm`. At `minimal`, read `design/game-brief.md` in its place; if that
  is absent too, stop — there is no design record to architect against.
- **Either present but empty or still template placeholders** — treat as absent.
  Present-but-empty is the case that most looks like present.

Do not proceed on a partial read and note it later. This phase is where design
assumptions get baked into ADRs, and an assumption made here is re-derived by
everything downstream rather than re-checked.
3. Project config — `naming.*` and `performance.*` from `project.yaml` (for any
   key absent or empty, fall back to `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`);
   allowed libraries and forbidden patterns from
   `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` (not migrated to project.yaml)
4. **Every GDD in `design/gdd/`** — extract technical requirements from the
   sections that carry them, **not from whole files**. Establish the denominator
   first (glob `design/gdd/*.md`, count **N**), then:
   ```
   Grep pattern="^## (Detailed Rules|Detailed Design|Formulas|Dependencies|Tuning Knobs|Acceptance Criteria)" glob="design/gdd/*.md" output_mode="content" -A 40
   ```
   Overview and Player Fantasy are narrative and imply no architecture; the
   scanned set is where rules, numbers, and cross-system contracts live. Accept
   either `## Detailed Rules` or `## Detailed Design` — the design standard and
   the GDD template disagree on the name and they denote the same section.

   Full-read a GDD when it matched **zero** sections (it predates the template —
   a zero-match means "unstructured", never "no requirements") or when a scanned
   section refers to material outside itself. **Never treat an absent section as
   an absent requirement**: report any GDD that contributed nothing, rather than
   letting it drop silently out of the baseline below.

   For each, extract:
   - Data structures implied by the game rules
   - Performance constraints stated or implied
   - Engine capabilities the system requires
   - Cross-system communication patterns (what talks to what, how)
   - State that must persist (save/load implications)
   - Threading or timing requirements

Build a **Technical Requirements Baseline** — a flat list of all extracted
requirements across all GDDs, numbered `TR-[gdd-slug]-[NNN]`. This is the
complete set of what the architecture must cover. Present it as:

```
## Technical Requirements Baseline
Extracted from [N] GDDs | [X] total requirements

| Req ID | GDD | System | Requirement | Domain |
|--------|-----|--------|-------------|--------|
| TR-combat-001 | combat.md | Combat | Hitbox detection per-frame | Physics |
| TR-combat-002 | combat.md | Combat | Combo state machine | Core |
| TR-inventory-001 | inventory.md | Inventory | Item persistence | Save/Load |
```

This baseline feeds into every subsequent phase. No GDD requirement should be
left without an architectural decision to support it by the end of this session.

### 0c. Existing Architecture Decisions

To learn **what has already been decided and in which domain**, scan the ADR
headers — do not full-read every ADR to produce a list of numbers and domains:
```
Grep pattern="^## (Status|Summary)" glob="docs/architecture/adr-*.md" output_mode="content" -A 4
Grep pattern="\*\*Domain\*\*" glob="docs/architecture/adr-*.md" output_mode="content"
```
`## Summary` (a 2-sentence what-and-why) plus `## Status` and the Engine
Compatibility `Domain` field are exactly "what was decided and its domain". List
the ADRs found, their status, and their domains from the scan. Full-read a
specific ADR only when a new decision this session would collide with it and you
need its reasoning — not to build the inventory.

### 0d. Generate Knowledge Gap Inventory

Before proceeding, display a structured summary:

```
## Engine Knowledge Gap Inventory
Engine: [name + version]
LLM Training Covers: up to approximately [version]
Post-Cutoff Versions: [list]

### HIGH RISK Domains (must verify against engine reference before deciding)
- [Domain]: [Key changes]

### MEDIUM RISK Domains (verify key APIs)
- [Domain]: [Key changes]

### LOW RISK Domains (in training data, likely reliable)
- [Domain]: [no significant post-cutoff changes]

### Systems from GDD that touch HIGH/MEDIUM risk domains:
- [GDD system name] → [domain] → [risk level]
```

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Prompt: "One or more engine domains are HIGH RISK — the LLM's knowledge may be unreliable for these areas. Architectural recommendations in these domains should be cross-referenced with the engine docs before being acted on. How would you like to proceed?"
- Options:
  - `[A] Proceed — flag HIGH RISK domains throughout the output`
  - `[B] Let me check the engine reference first — pause here`
  - `[C] Show me which domains are HIGH RISK and why`

### 0e. Existing Architecture Document

Glob `docs/architecture/architecture.md`. If it exists, this run updates it —
it never replaces it unasked. Read its `## Document Status` block and its `##`
headings, then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Prompt: "An architecture document already exists (v[N], [last updated]). What should this run do?"
- Options: `[A] Update chosen sections in place` / `[B] Rewrite the whole document — replaces the existing file` / `[C] Stop`

On `[A]`, ask which sections. Phases 1–6 author only those and say which they
skipped; Phase 7 replaces just those sections and raises `Version` to N+1,
leaving every other section as it is. `[B]` runs the full walkthrough, and
Phase 7's ask says it replaces the existing file.

A focus-area argument (`layers`, `data-flow`, `api-boundaries`, `adr-audit`)
is `[A]` with that one section chosen: it runs only its phase (1, 3, 4 or 5),
and Phase 7 writes that section. Phase 7b still runs on the updated document —
an update is reviewed like a first draft, at the review modes that review one. With no existing document there is nothing to
update — say so, and offer the full walkthrough instead.

---

## Phase 1: System Layer Mapping

Map every system from `systems-index.md` into an architecture layer. The standard
game architecture layers are:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PRESENTATION LAYER                         │  ← UI, HUD, menus, VFX, audio
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FEATURE LAYER                              │  ← gameplay systems, AI, quests
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CORE LAYER                                 │  ← physics, input, combat, movement
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FOUNDATION LAYER                           │  ← engine integration, save/load,
│                                             │    scene management, event bus
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PLATFORM LAYER                             │  ← OS, hardware, engine API surface
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For each GDD system, ask:
- Which layer does it belong to?
- What are its module boundaries?
- What does it own exclusively? (data, state, behaviour)

Present the proposed layer assignment and ask for approval before proceeding to
the next section. Record the approved layer map in
`production/session-state/active.md`; it goes into the document at Phase 7.

**Engine awareness check**: For each system assigned to the Core and Foundation
layers, flag if it touches a HIGH or MEDIUM risk engine domain. Show the relevant
engine reference excerpt inline.

---

## Phase 2: Module Ownership Map

For each module defined in Phase 1, define ownership:

- **Owns**: what data and state this module is solely responsible for
- **Exposes**: what other modules may read or call
- **Consumes**: what it reads from other modules
- **Engine APIs used**: which specific engine classes/nodes/signals this module
  calls directly (with version and risk level noted)

Format as a table per layer, then as an ASCII dependency diagram.

**Engine awareness check**: For every engine API listed, verify against the
relevant module reference doc. If an API is post-cutoff, flag it:

```
⚠️  [ClassName.method()] — Godot 4.6 (post-cutoff, HIGH risk)
    Verified against: docs/engine-reference/godot/modules/[domain].md
    Behaviour confirmed: [yes / NEEDS VERIFICATION]
```

Get user approval on the ownership map, then record it in
`production/session-state/active.md`; it is written at Phase 7.

---

## Phase 3: Data Flow

Define how data moves between modules during key game scenarios. Cover at minimum:

1. **Frame update path**: Input → Core systems → State → Rendering
2. **Event/signal path**: How systems communicate without tight coupling
3. **Save/load path**: What state is serialised, which module owns serialisation
4. **Initialisation order**: Which modules must boot before others

Use ASCII sequence diagrams where helpful. For each data flow:
- Name the data being transferred
- Identify the producer and consumer
- State whether this is synchronous call, signal/event, or shared state
- Flag any data flows that cross thread boundaries

Get user approval on each scenario, then record it in
`production/session-state/active.md`; it is written at Phase 7.

---

## Phase 4: API Boundaries

Define the public contracts between modules. For each boundary:

- What is the interface a module exposes to the rest of the system?
- What are the entry points (functions/signals/properties)?
- What invariants must callers respect?
- What must the module guarantee to callers?

Write in pseudocode or the project's actual language (from technical preferences).
These become the contracts programmers implement against.

**Engine awareness check**: If any interface uses engine-specific types (e.g.
`Node`, `Resource`, `Signal` in Godot), flag the version and verify the type
exists and has not changed signature in the target engine version.

Get user approval on the API boundaries, then record them in
`production/session-state/active.md`; they are written at Phase 7.

---

## Phase 5: ADR Audit + Traceability Check

Review all existing ADRs from Phase 0c against both the architecture built in
Phases 1-4 AND the Technical Requirements Baseline from Phase 0b.

### ADR Quality Check

For each ADR:
- [ ] Does it have an Engine Compatibility section?
- [ ] Is the engine version recorded?
- [ ] Are post-cutoff APIs flagged?
- [ ] Does it have a "GDD Requirements Addressed" section?
- [ ] Does it conflict with the layer/ownership decisions made in this session?
- [ ] Is it still valid for the pinned engine version?

| ADR | Engine Compat | Version | GDD Linkage | Conflicts | Valid |
|-----|--------------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| ADR-0001: [title] | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | None/[conflict] | ✅/⚠️ |

### Traceability Coverage Check

Map every requirement from the Technical Requirements Baseline to existing ADRs.
For each requirement, check if any ADR's "GDD Requirements Addressed" section
or decision text covers it:

| Req ID | Requirement | ADR Coverage | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| TR-combat-001 | Hitbox detection per-frame | ADR-0003 | ✅ |
| TR-combat-002 | Combo state machine | — | ❌ GAP |

Count: X covered, Y gaps. For each gap, it becomes a **Required New ADR**.

### Required New ADRs

List all decisions made during this architecture session (Phases 1-4) that do
not yet have a corresponding ADR, PLUS all uncovered Technical Requirements.
Group by layer — Foundation first:

**Foundation Layer (must create before any coding):**
- `/architecture-decision [title]` → covers: TR-[id], TR-[id]

**Core Layer:**
- `/architecture-decision [title]` → covers: TR-[id]

---

## Phase 6: Missing ADR List

Based on the full architecture, produce a complete list of ADRs that should exist
but don't yet. Group by priority:

**Must have before coding starts (Foundation & Core decisions):**
- [e.g. "Scene management and scene loading strategy"]
- [e.g. "Event bus vs direct signal architecture"]

**Should have before the relevant system is built:**
- [e.g. "Inventory serialisation format"]

**Can defer to implementation:**
- [e.g. "Specific shader technique for water"]

---

## Phase 7: Write the Master Architecture Document

Once all sections are approved, write the complete document to
`docs/architecture/architecture.md`.

In an update (Phase 0e `[A]`, or a focus-area argument), write only the chosen
sections instead, replacing each in place with `Edit`, and raise `Version`; the
ask below then names those sections and the version change.

Display a one-paragraph summary of what the document will contain (layers, modules, data flows, ADR gaps). Then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "All sections approved. May I write the master architecture document?"
  - [A] Yes — write to `docs/architecture/architecture.md` now
  - [B] Show me the full draft inline first, then ask again
  - [C] Not yet — I have more changes to discuss

The document structure:

```markdown
# [Game Name] — Master Architecture

## Phase 7b: Technical Director Sign-Off + Lead Programmer Feasibility Review

After writing the master architecture document, perform an explicit sign-off before handoff.

**Review mode check** — apply before spawning either gate:
- `solo` → skip both. Note: "TD-ARCHITECTURE and LP-FEASIBILITY skipped — Solo mode." Go to Step 4 and record both as skipped, then Phase 8.
- `lean` → skip both (neither is a PHASE-GATE). Note: "TD-ARCHITECTURE and LP-FEASIBILITY skipped — Lean mode." Go to Step 4 and record both as skipped, then Phase 8.
- `full` → spawn both, in parallel.

**Step 1 — Spawn `technical-director` via `Agent` using gate TD-ARCHITECTURE (`.claude/docs/director-gates/td-architecture.md`):**

Pass: the architecture document path (`docs/architecture/architecture.md`), the Technical Requirements Baseline (TR-IDs and count), the ADR list with statuses, and the Engine Knowledge Gap Inventory from Phase 0d. Issue this call and Step 2's before waiting for either result.

**Step 2 — Spawn `lead-programmer` via `Agent` using gate LP-FEASIBILITY (`.claude/docs/director-gates/lp-feasibility.md`):**

Pass: architecture document path, technical requirements baseline summary, ADR list.

**Step 3 — Present both assessments to the user:**

Show the TD-ARCHITECTURE verdict (APPROVE / CONCERNS / REJECT) and the LP-FEASIBILITY verdict (FEASIBLE / CONCERNS / INFEASIBLE) side by side.

Use `AskUserQuestion` — "Technical Director and Lead Programmer have reviewed the architecture. How would you like to proceed?"
Options: `Accept — proceed to handoff` / `Revise flagged items first` / `Discuss specific concerns`.
If either verdict is REJECT or INFEASIBLE, do not offer `Accept` — the blockers are revised (or discussed) first.
`Revise flagged items first` re-drafts each flagged section and shows it for approval as in Phases 1–4; the revised document is then written once, through Phase 7's ask, and Step 4 records `REVISED after [verdict]`.
A `NOT ASSESSED` answer is never recorded as `APPROVE` or `FEASIBLE`: Step 4 records it with the input that was missing (`director-gates.md`).

**Step 4 — Record sign-off in the architecture document:**

Update the Document Status section:
```
- TD-ARCHITECTURE: [date] — APPROVE / CONCERNS (accepted) / REVISED after CONCERNS / REVISED after REJECT / NOT ASSESSED — [missing input] / skipped — [mode] mode
- LP-FEASIBILITY: [date] — FEASIBLE / CONCERNS (accepted) / REVISED after CONCERNS / REVISED after INFEASIBLE / NOT ASSESSED — [missing input] / skipped — [mode] mode
```

Show the proposed Document Status block inline, then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "May I update the Document Status section with the sign-off results?"
  - [A] Yes — apply to `docs/architecture/architecture.md`
  - [B] Not yet — I want to revisit the concerns first

---

## Phase 8: Handoff

**Step 1 — Update session state**: Write a summary to `production/session-state/active.md` covering: artifact written, TD/LP sign-off verdicts, any blockers, required ADRs remaining, and next step.

**Step 2 — Output the handoff** using exactly this template (no freeform prose, no rephrasing of section titles):

---

## Architecture Complete

`docs/architecture/architecture.md` v[N] — [TD-ARCHITECTURE: APPROVE / CONCERNS (accepted) / REVISED after CONCERNS / REVISED after REJECT / NOT ASSESSED / skipped — [mode] mode]. [One sentence on what the architecture covers.]

---

## Run These ADRs Next

**1. `/architecture-decision "[Title]"` → ADR-[XXXX]**
[One sentence: what it defines and what it unblocks.]

**2. `/architecture-decision "[Title]"` → ADR-[XXXX]**
[One sentence.]

**3. `/architecture-decision "[Title]"` → ADR-[XXXX]**
[One sentence.]

**Then:** `/architecture-review`, and `/create-control-manifest` once it passes and those ADRs are Accepted — it turns them into the layer rules manifest.

List top 3 from Phase 6 in priority order. If fewer than 3 remain, list only what's outstanding.

---

## Gate-Check Readiness

> **Required before `/gate-check pre-production`:**
> - [ ] Accept ADRs: [list Proposed ADR IDs that must be Accepted]
> - [ ] Write ADRs: [list ADR IDs that must still be written]
> - [ ] Run `/architecture-review` — writes the review report and the traceability index (`docs/architecture/requirements-traceability.md`) the gate reads
> - [ ] Run `/test-setup` — scaffolds `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, CI workflow, and an example test file
> - [ ] Run `/ux-design` — creates `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` and `design/accessibility-requirements.md`
>
> Run `/gate-check pre-production` when all boxes are checked.

If nothing is blocking, write instead:
> No blockers — run `/gate-check pre-production` now.

---

## Open Questions to Watch

| ID | Summary | Priority | Resolution Path |
|----|---------|----------|-----------------|
| QQ-XX | [short description] | High / Medium / Low | [ADR or system that resolves it] |

Omit this section entirely if there are no open QQs.

---

(End of handoff. Do not add trailing commentary after the closing rule.)

---

## Collaborative Protocol

**Applies in `collaborative` mode (the default).** For `guided` and
`autonomous` modes, see `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md` — the rules below
describe what collaborative mode requires, not universal behavior.

This skill follows the collaborative design principle at every phase:

1. **Load context silently** — do not narrate file reads
2. **Present findings** — show the knowledge gap inventory and layer proposals
3. **Ask before deciding** — present options for each architectural choice
4. **Draft before approval** — show the content inline before asking to write it.
   Never ask approval for a section the user has not yet seen.
5. **Use `AskUserQuestion` for write approvals** — plain text "May I?" is not
   sufficient. Use the structured tool with labeled options [A]/[B]/[C] (write now /
   show full draft first / not yet). For multi-file changesets, list every file
   and what changes, then ask once grouped — not separate plain-text asks per file.
6. **One write, after every section is approved** — the document is written once,
   at Phase 7; Phase 7b's Step 4 only updates its Document Status, after its own
   ask. Record each approved section's decisions in
   `production/session-state/active.md` as you go, so a crash loses no decision.
   A revision that Phase 7b forces is written the same way — once, after its
   re-drafted sections are approved — and an update (Phase 0e) writes only the
   sections it chose.

Never make a binding architectural decision without user input. If the user is
unsure, present 2-4 options with pros/cons before asking them to decide.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

- Run `/architecture-decision [title]` for each required ADR listed in Phase 6 — Foundation layer ADRs first
- Run `/architecture-review` — bootstraps the Requirements Traceability Matrix and TR registry from the ADRs just written. Required before the Pre-Production gate.
- Run `/test-setup` to scaffold `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, CI workflow, and an example test (required for gate-check)
- Run `/ux-design` to initialize `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` and `design/accessibility-requirements.md` (required for gate-check)
- Run `/create-control-manifest` once the required ADRs are written to produce the layer rules manifest
- Run `/gate-check pre-production` when all required ADRs, `/test-setup`, and `/ux-design` are complete
