# QA Plan

This skill generates a structured QA plan for a sprint, feature, or individual
story. It reads all in-scope story files and their referenced GDDs, classifies
each story by test type, and produces a plan that tells developers exactly what
to automate, what to verify manually, what the smoke test scope is, and when
to bring in a playtester.

Run this before a sprint begins so the team knows upfront what testing work
is required. A test plan written after implementation is a post-mortem, not a
plan.

**Output:** `production/qa/qa-plan-[sprint-slug]-[date].md`

---

Every `AskUserQuestion` call follows `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative asks always · guided major-only · autonomous logs and proceeds;
`automation_always_ask` categories always prompt).

**Workflow tier**: resolve per the GDD's system as each is read (per
`.claude/docs/workflow-modes.md`): `workflow_overrides.system_overrides.<system>`
if the block lists one, else the project value. It sets how many GDD sections
the test plan is mined from — see Phase 2.

**`qa.level`**: at `minimal`, produce only a minimal smoke
plan — drop the automated-test-required rows and the test-file DoD; at `standard`,
a full plan per story type; at `full`, also add per-system coverage targets.
Distinct axis from `workflow` (which sets how many GDD sections are mined).
No level drops the Visual/Feel and UI screenshot rows — tests are waived at
`minimal`, the look is not (`.claude/docs/coding-standards.md`).

## Phase 1: Parse Scope

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (blank = ask user via AskUserQuestion)

Determine scope from the argument:

- **`sprint`** — read the most recent file in `production/sprints/`, extract
  every story file path referenced. If `production/sprint-status.yaml` exists,
  use it as the primary story list and fall back to the sprint plan for story
  metadata.
- **`feature: [system-name]`** — glob `production/epics/*/story-*.md`, filter
  to stories whose file path or title contains the system name. Also check the
  epic index file (`EPIC.md`) in that system's directory.
- **`story: [path]`** — validate that the path exists and load that single file.
- **No argument** — use `AskUserQuestion`:
  - "What is the scope for this QA plan?"
  - Options: "Current sprint", "Specific feature (enter system name)",
    "Specific story (enter path)", "Full epic"

After resolving scope, report: "Building QA plan for [N] stories in [scope]."

If a story file path is referenced but the file does not exist, note it as
MISSING and continue with the remaining stories. Do not fail the entire plan
for one missing file.

> **If the resolved scope contains ZERO stories, stop — do not build a plan.**
> Report `NOT ASSESSED — no stories in scope`, naming which scope was searched
> and which path was empty, and route:
> - no file in `production/sprints/` → "No sprint plan found. Run `/sprint-plan new`."
>   At `workflow: minimal` there are no sprints by design — route instead to
>   `/qa-plan feature: [epic-slug]` or `/qa-plan story: [path]`.
> - a sprint plan exists but references no stories → "Sprint plan `[path]` lists no
>   stories. Run `/create-stories [epic-slug]`."
> - `feature:`/`story:` scope matched nothing → name the glob that came back empty.
>
> **The N=0 guard is mandatory.** Without it an empty scope reports "Building QA
> plan for 0 stories" and continues into Phase 4, producing a plan document with
> empty tables — and **a QA plan for zero stories looks exactly like a completed
> QA plan.** This skill gates the hand-off to manual QA, so a false-clean here
> sends a build to QA on the strength of a plan that tested nothing.
>
> Note the shape, because this skill already had the harder half of the rule.
> Phase 2 states **"Never treat an absent section as an absent story"** — the
> sophisticated inner case, correctly handled. The outer boundary, no stories at
> all, had nothing. The same shape appears in `/story-readiness`, where `NOT ASSESSED`
> existed for per-story failures and the empty scope could not reach it.
>
> The rule at the top of this block still stands: one missing file among several
> is MISSING-and-continue. This is the different case where there is no *several*.

## Phase 2: Load Inputs

Establish the denominator first — glob the in-scope story files and count **N** —
then collect the fields below with **targeted section greps, not a full read of
each story**. A QA plan needs each story's type and acceptance criteria; it does
not need its implementation notes, out-of-scope boundaries or ADR rationale, and
reading N stories whole to reach two sections is where this phase's cost lives:

```
Grep pattern="^## Acceptance Criteria" glob="production/epics/**/story-*.md" output_mode="content" -A 15
Grep pattern="^> \*\*(Type|Status|Estimate)\*\*" glob="production/epics/**/story-*.md" output_mode="content"
Grep pattern="^## (Context|Dependencies)" glob="production/epics/**/story-*.md" output_mode="content" -A 8
```

(Scope the globs to the sprint plan's story paths in `sprint` mode.) From those:

- **Story title** and story ID — from the file name and path; no read at all
- **Story Type** field — from the header grep (e.g., `Type: Logic`)
- **Acceptance criteria** — the complete numbered/bulleted list, from the first grep
- **GDD / ADR reference** and **Dependencies** — from the `## Context` grep
- **Estimate** — from the header grep if present
- **Implementation files** and **Engine notes** — only needed for stories whose
  test plan actually turns on them; full-read those individual stories

**Never treat an absent section as an absent story.** If a story matched no
`## Acceptance Criteria`, full-read that one and say so — a story with no
testable criteria is a QA finding in its own right, not a story to skip.

After reading stories, load supporting context once (not per story):

- `design/gdd/systems-index.md` — to understand system priorities and which
  GDDs are approved
- For each unique GDD referenced across all stories: mine test material per that
  system's workflow tier (resolved above) — at `full`, mine all 8 sections; at
  `standard`, mine the test-relevant subset of the required sections
  (**Acceptance Criteria** and **Edge Cases** always, plus **Formulas** for any
  system that defines numeric rules); at `minimal`, **Acceptance
  Criteria only**. Do not load the full GDD
  text. These sections contain the testable requirements, the math to verify, and
  the boundary conditions tests must cover. If an Edge Cases section is absent (or
  not expected at minimal), note per GDD: "No Edge Cases section found — edge case
  coverage will be inferred from acceptance criteria only."
- `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md` — scan for forbidden patterns that
  automated tests should guard against (if the file exists)

If no GDD is referenced in a story, note it as a gap but do not block the plan.
The story will be classified using acceptance criteria alone.

---

## Phase 3: Classify Each Story

For each story, assign a Story Type:

- **If the story already has a `Type:` field in its header**: accept it as-is. Do NOT re-classify or validate against the criteria below — the Type was set by lead-programmer at story creation and is authoritative. Record it as-is.
- **If the `Type:` field is missing**: infer the type from the acceptance criteria using the table below, and note in the report that the type was inferred (not declared). Flag this as a gap — the story should have its Type declared explicitly before implementation begins.

| Story Type | Classification Indicators |
|---|---|
| **Logic** | Acceptance criteria reference calculations, formulas, numerical thresholds, state transitions, AI decisions, data validation, buff/debuff stacking, economy transactions, or any testable computation |
| **Integration** | Criteria involve two or more systems interacting, signals or events propagating across system boundaries, save/load round-trips, network sync, or persistence |
| **Visual/Feel** | Criteria reference animation behaviour, VFX, shader output, "feels responsive", perceived timing, screen shake, particle effects, audio sync, or visual feedback quality |
| **UI** | Criteria reference menus, HUD elements, buttons, screens, dialogue boxes, inventory panels, tooltips, or any player-facing interface element |
| **Config/Data** | Changes are limited to balance tuning values, data files, or configuration — no new code logic is involved |

**Mixed stories** (e.g., a story that adds both a formula and a UI display):
assign the primary type based on which acceptance criteria carry the highest
implementation risk, and note the secondary type. Mixed Logic+Integration or
Visual+UI combinations are the most common.

After classifying all stories, produce a classification summary table in
conversation before proceeding to Phase 4. This gives the user visibility into
how tests will be allocated.

## Phase 4: Generate Test Plan

Assemble the full QA plan document. Use this structure:

````markdown
# QA Plan: [Sprint/Feature Name]
**Date**: [date]
**Generated by**: /qa-plan
**Scope**: [N stories across [N systems]]
**Engine**: [engine name — `engine.name` from project.yaml if present and non-empty, else the Engine field from .claude/docs/technical-preferences.md, else "Not configured"]
**Sprint File**: [path to sprint plan if applicable]

---

## Test Summary

| Story | Type | Automated Test Required | Manual Verification Required |
|-------|------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| [story title] | Logic | Unit test — `tests/unit/[system]/` | None |
| [story title] | Integration | Integration test — `tests/integration/[system]/` | Smoke check |
| [story title] | Visual/Feel | None (not automatable) | Screenshot + lead sign-off |
| [story title] | UI | None (verified by its screenshots) | Retained screenshot of each screen touched |
| [story title] | Config/Data | Data validation test | Spot-check in-game values |

---

## Automated Tests Required

*(At `qa.level: minimal`, omit this entire section and blank the Test Summary's
"Automated Test Required" column — automated tests are not required there; list
manual/smoke verification only.)*

### [Story Title] — [Type]
**Test file path**: `tests/[unit|integration]/[system]/[story-slug]_test.[ext]`
**What to test**:
- [Specific formula or rule from the GDD Formulas section]
- [Each named state transition or decision branch]
- [Each side effect that should or should not occur]

**Edge cases to cover**:
- Zero/minimum input values (e.g., 0 damage, empty inventory)
- Maximum/boundary input values (e.g., max level, stat cap)
- Invalid or null input (e.g., missing target, dead entity)
- [Any edge case explicitly called out in the GDD Edge Cases section]

**Estimated test count**: ~[N] unit tests

[If no GDD formula reference was found for this story, note:]
*No formula found in referenced GDD — test cases must be derived from acceptance
criteria directly. Review the GDD Formulas section before writing tests.*

---

## Manual QA Checklist

### [Story Title] — [Type]
**Verification method**: [Screenshot + designer sign-off | Playtest session |
Manual step-through | Comparison against reference footage]
**Who must sign off**: [designer / lead-programmer / qa-lead / art-director]
**Evidence to capture**: [screenshot of X | video clip of Y | written playtest
notes | side-by-side comparison]

Checklist:
- [ ] [Specific observable condition — concrete and falsifiable]
- [ ] [Another condition]
- [ ] [Every acceptance criterion translated into a manual check item]

*If any criterion uses subjective language ("feels", "looks", "seems"), it must
be supplemented with a specific benchmark or a playtest protocol note.*

---

## Smoke Test Scope

Critical paths to verify before any QA hand-off for this sprint:

1. Game launches to main menu without crash
2. New game / new session can be started
3. [Primary mechanic introduced or changed this sprint]
4. [Any system with a regression risk from this sprint's changes]
5. Save / load cycle completes without data loss (if save system exists)
6. Performance is within budget on target hardware (no new frame spikes)

*Smoke tests are verified by the developer via `/smoke-check`. Reference this
list when running that skill.*

---

## Playtest Requirements

| Story | Playtest Goal | Min Sessions | Target Player Type |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [story] | [What question must the session answer?] | [N] | [new player / experienced] |

**Sign-off requirement**: Playtest notes must be written to
`production/session-logs/playtest-[sprint]-[story-slug].md` and reviewed by
the [designer / qa-lead] before the story can be marked COMPLETE.

If no stories require playtest validation: *No playtest sessions required for
this sprint.*

---

## Definition of Done — This Sprint

A story is DONE when ALL of the following are true (at `qa.level: minimal`, drop
the test-file and smoke rows below — tests are waived there; the screenshot and
sign-off rows stay at every level, because the look is not):

- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified — via automated test result OR documented
      manual evidence (screenshot, video, or playtest notes with sign-off)
- [ ] Test file exists at the specified path for all Logic and Integration stories *(qa.level standard/full)*
- [ ] Retained screenshot of each screen touched, in `production/qa/evidence/`, for all Visual/Feel and UI stories *(every qa.level)*
- [ ] Signed-off evidence doc at `production/qa/evidence/[story-slug]-evidence.md` for all Visual/Feel stories *(every qa.level)*
- [ ] Smoke check passes (run `/smoke-check sprint` before QA hand-off) *(qa.level standard/full)*
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Code reviewed (via `/code-review` or documented peer review)
- [ ] Story file updated to `Status: Complete` (via `/story-done`)
````

When generating content, use the actual story titles, GDD formula text, and
acceptance criteria extracted in Phase 2. Do not use placeholder text — every
test entry should reflect the real requirements of these specific stories.

---

## Phase 5: Write Output

Show the complete plan in conversation (or a summary if the plan is very long),
then ask two questions together using `AskUserQuestion`:

```
question: "Ready to write the QA plan. Choose output options:"
multiSelect: true
options:
  - "Write QA plan to production/qa/qa-plan-[sprint-slug]-[date].md"
  - "Also back-fill test case specs into each story file's ## QA Test Cases section (Recommended — enables /dev-story and /code-review traceability)"
```

If "Write QA plan" is selected: write the plan file exactly as generated — do not truncate.

If "Also back-fill story files" is selected: for each Logic and Integration story in scope, edit the story file at its path. Find the `## QA Test Cases` section and replace its content with the test case specs generated in Phase 4 for that story. If a story has no `## QA Test Cases` section, append it before `## Test Evidence`. For Visual/Feel and UI stories, write the manual verification steps instead of test specs.

After writing:

"QA plan written to `production/qa/qa-plan-[sprint-slug]-[date].md`.

Next steps:
- Share this plan with the team before sprint implementation begins
- Once all sprint stories are implemented, run `/smoke-check sprint` to gate QA hand-off — not yet, only after implementation is complete
- For Logic/Integration stories, create the test files at the listed paths
  before marking stories done — `/story-done` checks for them"

Silently append to `production/session-state/active.md` (create the file if it does not exist):

```
<!-- QA-PLAN: [date] | System: [system/sprint identifier] | Plan written: production/qa/qa-plan-[identifier]-[date].md -->
```

Close with the verdict: **COMPLETE** — QA plan written (or **COMPLETE** — QA plan
shown, not written, if the write was declined). The only other outcome is the
`NOT ASSESSED — no stories in scope` path in Phase 1.

---

## Collaborative Protocol

**Applies in `collaborative` mode (the default).** For `guided` and
`autonomous` modes, see `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md` — the rules below
describe what collaborative mode requires, not universal behavior.

- **Never write the plan without asking** — Phase 5 requires explicit approval.
- **Classify conservatively**: when a story is ambiguous between Logic and
  Integration, classify it as Integration — it requires both unit and
  integration tests.
- **Do not invent test cases** beyond what acceptance criteria and GDD formulas
  support. If a formula is absent from the GDD, flag it rather than guessing.
- **Playtest requirements are advisory**: the user decides whether a playtest
  is warranted for borderline Visual/Feel stories. Flag the case; do not mandate.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for scope selection when no argument is provided.
  Keep all other phases non-interactive — present findings, then ask once to
  approve the write.
