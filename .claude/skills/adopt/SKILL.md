Resolved above — use as-is. `/adopt` also inspects `project.yaml` and the legacy
config files directly when reporting and writing migration state; that raw
inspection is deliberate and separate from the resolved values above.


# Adopt — Brownfield Template Adoption

This skill audits an existing project's artifacts for **format compliance** with
the template's skill pipeline, then produces a prioritised migration plan.

**This is not `/project-stage-detect`.**
`/project-stage-detect` answers: *what exists?*
`/adopt` answers: *will what exists actually work with the template's skills?*

A project can have GDDs, ADRs, and stories — and every format-sensitive skill
will still fail silently or produce wrong results if those artifacts are in the
wrong internal format.

**Output:** `docs/adoption-plan-[date].md` — a persistent, checkable migration plan.

**Argument modes:**

**Audit mode:** `$ARGUMENTS` (blank = `full`)

- **No argument / `full`**: Complete audit — all artifact types
- **`gdds`**: GDD format compliance only
- **`adrs`**: ADR format compliance only
- **`stories`**: Story format compliance only
- **`infra`**: Infrastructure artifact gaps only (registry, manifest, sprint-status, stage.txt)

---

**Automation mode**: Resolve `modes.automation` (`project.local.yaml` →
`project.yaml` → default `collaborative`). Every `AskUserQuestion` call follows `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative asks always · guided major-only · autonomous logs and proceeds;
`automation_always_ask` categories always prompt).

**`workflow`** (per `.claude/docs/workflow-modes.md`). It scopes the Phase 2 audit and
Phase 3 severity: `full` audits all doc types at full structure; `standard` audits
only the required docs/sections (optional sections are informational, not gaps);
`minimal` is a `design/game-brief.md` format check — GDDs/ADRs/UX are not expected. See Phase 2.

## Phase 1: Detect Project State

Emit one line before reading: `"Scanning project artifacts..."` — this confirms the
skill is running during the silent read phase.

Then read silently before presenting anything else.

### Existence check
- `project.stage` in `project.yaml` (fallback `production/stage.txt`) — if either is present, use that value (authoritative phase)
- `design/gdd/game-concept.md` (or, at the minimal tier, `design/game-brief.md`) — concept exists?
- `design/gdd/systems-index.md` — systems index exists?
- Count GDD files: `design/gdd/*.md` (excluding game-concept.md and systems-index.md)
- Count ADR files: `docs/architecture/adr-*.md`
- Count story files: `production/epics/**/*.md` (excluding EPIC.md)
- `project.yaml` (`engine.name`) / `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` — engine configured?
- `docs/engine-reference/` — engine reference docs present?
- Glob `docs/adoption-plan-*.md` — note the filename of the most recent prior plan if any exist

### Infer phase (if no project.stage / stage.txt)
Use the same heuristic as `/project-stage-detect`:
- 10+ source files in the code root → Production
- Stories in `production/epics/` → Pre-Production
- ADRs exist → Technical Setup
- systems-index.md exists → Systems Design
- game-concept.md (or `design/game-brief.md`) exists → Concept
- Nothing → Fresh (not a brownfield project — suggest `/start`)

If the project appears fresh (no artifacts at all), use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "This looks like a fresh project — no existing artifacts found. `/adopt` is for
  projects with work to migrate. What would you like to do?"
  - "Run `/start` — begin guided first-time onboarding"
  - "My artifacts are in a non-standard location — help me find them"
  - "Cancel"

Then stop — do not proceed with the audit regardless of which option the user picks
(each option leads to a different skill or manual investigation).

Report: "Detected phase: [phase]. Found: [N] GDDs, [M] ADRs, [P] stories."

---

## Phase 2: Format Audit

For each artifact type in scope (based on argument mode **and the resolved
workflow tier**), check not just that the file exists but that it contains the
internal structure the template requires. At `minimal`, scope the audit to
`design/game-brief.md` — do not audit for GDDs, ADRs, or UX specs (they are not expected).
Steps 2e (the Engine reference row only), 2f (project config) and 2g (v1.0
migration check) run at every tier.

### 2a: GDD Format Audit

**Gather section presence deterministically — do not read the GDDs to count
headings.** For each GDD discovered in Phase 1, pass its path explicitly to the
structure-check script:

```
Bash: bash .claude/scripts/gdd-structure-check.sh [path-to-gdd]
```

**Pass paths one at a time; do not invoke it bare.** The no-argument form sweeps
`design/gdd/` only, and a brownfield project's GDDs are not guaranteed to live
there — pass whatever paths Phase 1 found. The script prints a `PRESENT:` list
and, when applicable, an `ABSENT:` list per file. It reports **presence only**
and makes no REQUIRED/ADVISORY judgment (that is the tier logic below), and it
already accepts `## Detailed Design` as satisfying the `Detailed Rules`
requirement, so do not flag that alias as missing.

If the script prints `Not found:` for a path or errors, that is a **discovery
failure, not a format gap** — report it as "could not audit [path]" and do not
count it as a missing-sections finding.

**Then apply the workflow tier** resolved above to each file's PRESENT/ABSENT
lists. Which sections are **required** (a miss = gap) vs **advisory** (a miss =
informational):
- **`full`** — all 8 sections are required.
- **`standard`** — the 5 required (Overview, Detailed Rules, Edge Cases,
  Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria) + Formulas for any system that defines
  numeric rules (rates, curves, thresholds, costs — the system's `Category` is a
  hint, not the test); Player Fantasy and Tuning Knobs are advisory.
- **`minimal`** — GDDs are not expected; audit `design/game-brief.md` instead,
  against `.claude/docs/templates/game-brief.md`: each of the six required fields
  present and not a placeholder; the three one-liners advisory. Any GDD that
  does exist is checked at the `standard` bar, advisorily.

The script's 8 canonical labels are: Overview, Player Fantasy, Detailed Rules,
Formulas, Edge Cases, Dependencies, Tuning Knobs, Acceptance Criteria.

A section reported PRESENT can still be an empty heading. For each GDD, also
record with a targeted grep (not a full read):
- Placeholder-only sections — `Grep pattern="\[To be designed\]"` (or an
  equivalent empty/single-line body) marks a present-but-unwritten section.
- The `**Status**:` header field — `Grep pattern="^>?[[:space:]]*\*\*Status\*\*:"`.
  Valid values: `Draft`, `In Design`, `Designed`, `In Review`, `Approved`,
  `Implemented`, `Needs Revision`.

> **The `>?` is load-bearing, and so are `Draft`/`Implemented`.** Both emitters
> write this field inside a blockquote — `.claude/docs/templates/game-design-document.md`
> and `/design-system` produce `> **Status**: …` — so an anchor of
> `^\*\*Status\*\*:` matches nothing and reports *every* template-compliant GDD
> as missing its Status. The template's own value list offers `Draft` and
> `Implemented`, so both must count as valid.

### 2b: ADR Format Audit

For each ADR file found, check for these critical sections:

| Section | Impact if missing |
|---|---|
| `## Status` | **BLOCKING** — `/story-readiness` ADR status check silently passes everything |
| `## ADR Dependencies` | HIGH — dependency ordering in `/architecture-review` breaks |
| `## Engine Compatibility` | HIGH — post-cutoff API risk is unknown |
| `## GDD Requirements Addressed` | MEDIUM — traceability matrix loses coverage |
| `## Performance Implications` | LOW — not pipeline-critical |

For each ADR, record: which sections present, which missing, current Status value
if the Status section exists.

### 2c: systems-index.md Format Audit

If `design/gdd/systems-index.md` exists:

1. **Parenthetical status values** — Grep for any Status cell containing
   parentheses: `"Needs Revision ("`, `"In Progress ("`, etc.
   These break exact-string matching in `/gate-check`, `/create-stories`,
   and `/architecture-review`. **BLOCKING.**

2. **Valid status values** — check that Status column values are only from:
   `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Designed`, `Approved`, `Needs Revision`
   Flag any unrecognised values.

3. **Column structure** — check that the table has at minimum: System name,
   Layer, Priority, Status columns. Missing columns degrade skill functionality.

### 2d: Story Format Audit

For each story file found:

- **`Manifest Version:` field** — present in story header? (LOW — auto-passes if absent)
- **TR-ID reference** — does story contain `TR-[a-z]+-[0-9]+` pattern? (MEDIUM — no staleness tracking)
- **ADR reference** — does story reference at least one ADR? (check for `ADR-` pattern)
- **Status field** — present and readable?
- **Acceptance criteria** — does the story have a checkbox list (`- [ ]`)?

### 2e: Infrastructure Audit

| Artifact | Path | Impact if missing |
|---|---|---|
| TR registry | `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` | HIGH — no stable requirement IDs |
| Control manifest | `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md` | HIGH — no layer rules for stories |
| Manifest version stamp | In manifest header: `Manifest Version:` | MEDIUM — staleness checks blind |
| Sprint status | `production/sprint-status.yaml` | MEDIUM — `/sprint-status` falls back to markdown |
| Stage file | `project.stage` in `project.yaml` (fallback `production/stage.txt`) | MEDIUM — phase auto-detect unreliable |
| Engine reference | `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/VERSION.md` | HIGH — ADR engine checks blind |
| Architecture traceability | `docs/architecture/requirements-traceability.md` | MEDIUM — no persistent matrix |

At `workflow: minimal` only the Engine reference row applies. The TR registry,
control manifest and its version stamp, sprint status, stage file and
traceability matrix are not on the minimal path, so their absence is not a gap.

### 2f: Project Config Audit

Read `project.yaml` (the primary config store) and `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` (legacy mirror). A setting counts as configured if EITHER source has a real value (in technical-preferences.md, `[TO BE CONFIGURED]` means unconfigured):
- `engine.name`/`version`/`language`/`rendering`/`physics` (else the Engine/Language/Rendering/Physics fields) → HIGH if unconfigured in both (ADR skills fail)
- `naming.*` (else Naming conventions) → MEDIUM
- `performance.*` (else Performance budgets) → MEDIUM
- Forbidden Patterns, Allowed Libraries (technical-preferences.md only — not migrated to project.yaml) → LOW (starts empty by design)

### 2g: v1.0 Migration Check

A project is a **v1.0 project needing migration** when `project.yaml` does NOT
exist at the repo root AND at least one legacy file does: `production/stage.txt`,
`production/review-mode.txt`, or a `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` with
real values.

"Real values" means one of the keys the converter actually migrates — Engine,
Language, Rendering, Physics, the naming, platform and performance fields,
Framework, or the specialists. Not merely "some bullet is filled in": the
shipped template ships one prose default (`- **Required Tests**: …`) that is
never migrated, and counting it made every fresh clone read as a v1.0 project.

Do not hand-migrate. Run the converter, which is deterministic and covered by
the framework's own test suite:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/migrate-v1-config.sh --dry-run
```

The dry run writes nothing; record what it lists for the report. Do not run the
converter during the audit — Phase 2 reads silently. The migration is
classified BLOCKING in Phase 3, heads the plan, and **Phase 7 offers it as the
first action**: report what the dry run listed, then ask "May I run the
converter? It writes `project.yaml` and `production/migration-report.md`." If
the user approves, run it without `--dry-run`. It
writes `project.yaml` plus `production/migration-report.md` and **deletes
nothing** — the whole operation stays reversible with `git checkout`.

Then tell the user to read `production/migration-report.md` before running:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/migrate-v1-config.sh --finalize
```

`--finalize` deletes a legacy file only after proving its value is present in
`project.yaml`; on mismatch it deletes nothing and exits 4. It never deletes
`technical-preferences.md`, which still holds Forbidden Patterns and Allowed
Libraries.

**If the script refuses with exit 3**, do not work around it. Exit 3 means one
of two things, and the message says which:

- **the values DISAGREE** — two sources of truth and no way to know which the
  user edited last. Surface it and let them decide.
- **a `production/migration-report.md` is already present** — a migration ran
  here, so these are post-migration leftovers and `--finalize` is the next step,
  not a second `migrate`.

Both files merely *existing* is not exit 3 and must not be reported as a
conflict: `/start` writes `production/stage.txt` on every new v1.1 project as a
mirror, so agreement is the normal state. The script says
`the legacy files mirror it (values agree)` and exits 0 for that.

Classify as **BLOCKING** in Phase 3: until migration runs, every skill reads
config through the legacy fallback chain, and v1.1 settings are unavailable.

---

## Phase 3: Classify and Prioritise Gaps

Organise every gap found across all audits into four severity tiers:

**BLOCKING** — Will cause template skills to silently produce wrong results *right now*.
Examples: ADR missing Status field, systems-index parenthetical status values,
engine not configured when ADRs exist.

**HIGH** — Will cause stories to be generated with missing safety checks, or
infrastructure bootstrapping will fail.
Examples: ADRs missing Engine Compatibility, GDDs missing Acceptance Criteria
(stories can't be generated from them), tr-registry.yaml missing.

**MEDIUM** — Degrades quality and pipeline tracking but does not break functionality.
Examples: GDDs missing Tuning Knobs or Formulas sections, stories missing TR-IDs,
sprint-status.yaml missing.

**LOW** — Retroactive improvements that are nice-to-have but not urgent.
Examples: Stories missing Manifest Version stamps, GDDs missing Open Questions section.

Count totals per tier. If zero BLOCKING and zero HIGH gaps: report that the project
is template-compatible and only advisory improvements remain.

---

## Phase 4: Build the Migration Plan

Compose a numbered, ordered action plan. Ordering rules:
1. BLOCKING gaps first (must fix before any pipeline skill runs reliably)
2. HIGH gaps next, infrastructure before GDD/ADR content (bootstrapping needs correct formats)
3. MEDIUM gaps ordered: GDD gaps before ADR gaps before story gaps (stories depend on GDDs and ADRs)
4. LOW gaps last

For each gap, produce a plan entry with:
- A clear problem statement (one sentence, no jargon)
- The exact command to fix it, if a skill handles it
- Manual steps if it requires direct editing
- A time estimate (rough: 5 min / 30 min / 1 session)
- A checkbox `- [ ]` for tracking

**Special case — systems-index parenthetical status values:**
This is always the first item if present. Show the exact values that need changing
and the exact replacement text. Offer to fix this immediately before writing the plan.

**Special case — ADRs missing Status field:**
For each affected ADR, the fix is:
`/architecture-decision retrofit docs/architecture/adr-[NNNN]-[slug].md`
List each ADR as a separate checkable item.

**Special case — GDDs missing sections:**
For each affected GDD, list which sections are missing and the fix:
`/design-system retrofit design/gdd/[filename].md`

**Infrastructure bootstrap ordering** — always present in this sequence:
1. Fix ADR formats first (registry depends on reading ADR Status fields)
2. Run `/architecture-review` → bootstraps `tr-registry.yaml`
3. Run `/create-control-manifest` → creates manifest with version stamp
4. Run `/sprint-plan update` → creates `sprint-status.yaml`
5. Run `/gate-check [phase]` (the gate into the phase the project is in; at Concept there is none — Concept is the default stage, nothing to run) → writes `project.stage` in `project.yaml` (and legacy `stage.txt`) authoritatively

**At `workflow: minimal` the plan prescribes none of this sequence.** None of it
is on the minimal path: ADRs are not expected, the brief's build order is the
plan (no `/sprint-plan`), and nothing there runs `/gate-check`. The plan's
Step 3 says so in one line and names the path's next step instead —
`/create-stories` when no stories exist, else `/dev-story`.

**Existing stories** — note explicitly:
> "Existing stories continue to work with all template skills — all new format
> checks auto-pass when the fields are absent. They won't benefit from TR-ID
> staleness tracking or manifest version checks until they're regenerated. This
> is intentional: do not regenerate stories that are already in progress."

---

## Phase 5: Present Summary and Ask to Write

Present a compact summary before writing:

```
## Adoption Audit Summary
Phase detected: [phase]
Engine: [configured / NOT CONFIGURED]
GDDs audited: [N] ([X] fully compliant, [Y] with gaps)
ADRs audited: [N] ([X] fully compliant, [Y] with gaps)
Stories audited: [N]

Gap counts:
  BLOCKING: [N] — template skills will malfunction without these fixes
  HIGH:     [N] — unsafe to run /create-stories or /story-readiness
  MEDIUM:   [N] — quality degradation
  LOW:      [N] — optional improvements

Estimated remediation: [X blocking items × ~Y min each = roughly Z hours]
```

Before asking to write, show a **Gap Preview**:
- List every BLOCKING gap as a one-line bullet describing the actual problem
  (e.g. `systems-index.md: 3 rows have parenthetical status values`,
  `adr-0002.md: missing ## Status section`). No counts — show the actual items.
- Show HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW as counts only (e.g. `HIGH: 4, MEDIUM: 2, LOW: 1`).

This gives the user enough context to judge scope before committing to writing the file.

If a prior adoption plan was detected in Phase 1, add a note:
> "A previous plan exists at `docs/adoption-plan-[prior-date].md`. The new plan will
> reflect current project state — it does not diff against the prior run."

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "Ready to write the migration plan?"
  - "Yes — write `docs/adoption-plan-[date].md`"
  - "Show me the full plan preview first (don't write yet)"
  - "Cancel — I'll handle migration manually"

If the user picks "Show me the full plan preview", output the complete plan as a
fenced markdown block. Then ask again with the same three options.

---

## Phase 6: Write the Adoption Plan

If approved, write `docs/adoption-plan-[date].md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Adoption Plan

> **Generated**: [date]
> **Project phase**: [phase]
> **Engine**: [name + version, or "Not configured"]
> **Template version**: v1.0+

Work through these steps in order. Check off each item as you complete it.
Re-run `/adopt` anytime to check remaining gaps.

---

## Step 1: Fix Blocking Gaps

[One sub-section per blocking gap with problem, fix command, time estimate, checkbox]

---

## Step 2: Fix High-Priority Gaps

[One sub-section per high gap]

---

## Step 3: Bootstrap Infrastructure

[At `workflow: minimal`, replace 3a–3d with one line: "Not on the minimal path —
the brief's build order is the plan. Next: `/create-stories` (or `/dev-story`
once stories exist)."]

### 3a. Register existing requirements (creates tr-registry.yaml)
Run `/architecture-review` — even if ADRs already exist, this run bootstraps
the TR registry from your existing GDDs and ADRs.
**Time**: 1 session (review can be long for large codebases)
- [ ] tr-registry.yaml created

### 3b. Create control manifest
Run `/create-control-manifest`
**Time**: 30 min
- [ ] docs/architecture/control-manifest.md created

### 3c. Create sprint tracking file
Run `/sprint-plan update`
**Time**: 5 min (if sprint plan already exists as markdown)
- [ ] production/sprint-status.yaml created

### 3d. Set authoritative project stage
Run `/gate-check [current-phase]` (the gate into the phase the project is in;
at Concept there is none — Concept is the default stage, nothing to run)
**Time**: 5 min
- [ ] `project.stage` in `project.yaml` written (legacy `production/stage.txt` also updated)

---

## Step 4: Medium-Priority Gaps

[One sub-section per medium gap]

---

## Step 5: Optional Improvements

[One sub-section per low gap]

---

## What to Expect from Existing Stories

Existing stories continue to work with all template skills. New format checks
(TR-ID validation, manifest version staleness) auto-pass when the fields are
absent — so nothing breaks. They won't benefit from staleness tracking until
regenerated. Do not regenerate stories that are in progress or done.

---

## Re-run

Run `/adopt` again after completing Step 3 to verify all blocking and high gaps
are resolved. The new run will reflect the current state of the project.
```

---

## Phase 6b: Report Review Mode

**Do not write a review mode.** `modes.review_mode` is one of the six knobs
`modes.rigor` fronts: pinning it in `project.yaml` shadows the rigor expansion, and
the legacy `production/review-mode.txt` sits *above* that expansion in resolution,
so either write would freeze director-review depth for good — the rule `/start`
and `project.yaml`'s header comment both state.

Report the value the bootstrap above resolved instead: "Review mode resolves to
`[value]` — from `modes.rigor`, unless something pins it." If the user wants a
different depth, point them to changing `modes.rigor`, or to pinning it on purpose
with `/settings --local modes.review_mode=<full|lean|solo>` (a personal override in
`project.local.yaml`).

---

## Phase 7: Offer First Action

After writing the plan, don't stop there. Pick the single highest-priority gap
and offer to handle it immediately using `AskUserQuestion`. Choose the first
branch that applies:

**If Phase 2g found a v1.0 project needing migration:** offer the converter run
described there — report what the dry run listed and ask "May I run the
converter? It writes `project.yaml` and `production/migration-report.md`."
Every other fix reads config through it, so it comes first.

**If there are parenthetical status values in systems-index.md:**
Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "The most urgent fix is `systems-index.md` — [N] rows have parenthetical status
  values (e.g. `Needs Revision (see notes)`) that break /gate-check,
  /create-stories, and /architecture-review right now. I can fix these in-place."
  - "Fix it now — edit systems-index.md"
  - "I'll fix it myself"
  - "Done — leave me with the plan"

**If ADRs are missing `## Status` (and no parenthetical issue):**
Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "The most urgent fix is adding `## Status` to [N] ADR(s): [list filenames].
  Without it, /story-readiness silently passes all ADR checks. Start with
  [first affected filename]?"
  - "Yes — retrofit [first affected filename] now"
  - "Retrofit all [N] ADRs one by one"
  - "I'll handle ADRs myself"

**If GDDs are missing Acceptance Criteria (and no blocking issues above):**
Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "The most urgent gap is missing Acceptance Criteria in [N] GDD(s):
  [list filenames]. Without them, /create-stories can't generate stories.
  Start with [highest-priority GDD filename]?"
  - "Yes — add Acceptance Criteria to [GDD filename] now"
  - "Do all [N] GDDs one by one"
  - "I'll handle GDDs myself"

**Otherwise, if any BLOCKING or HIGH gap remains** (one no branch above names —
e.g. a missing TR registry):
Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "The most urgent remaining gap is [first BLOCKING or HIGH item in the plan] —
  [one line on what it breaks]. Start on it now?"
  - "Yes — start on [item]"
  - "Show me that plan item first"
  - "Done — leave me with the plan"

**If no BLOCKING or HIGH gaps exist:**
Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "No blocking gaps — this project is template-compatible. What next?"
  - "Walk me through the medium-priority improvements"
  - "Run /project-stage-detect for a broader health check"
  - "Done — I'll work through the plan at my own pace"

> **Adoption plan saved to `docs/adoption-plan-[date].md`.** Re-run `/adopt` at any time to re-check remaining gaps as you complete them.

---

## Collaborative Protocol

**Applies in `collaborative` mode (the default).** For `guided` and
`autonomous` modes, see `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md` — the rules below
describe what collaborative mode requires, not universal behavior.

1. **Read silently** — complete the full audit before presenting anything
2. **Show the summary first** — let the user see scope before asking to write
3. **Ask before writing** — always confirm before creating the adoption plan file
4. **Offer, don't force** — the plan is advisory; the user decides what to fix and when
5. **One action at a time** — after handing off the plan, offer one specific next step,
   not a list of six things to do simultaneously
6. **Never regenerate existing artifacts** — only fill gaps in what exists;
   do not rewrite GDDs, ADRs, or stories that already have content
