# Section Guidance — Interaction Pattern Library Mode


Pattern library authoring is additive and catalog-driven, not linear.

#### Phase 1: Catalog Existing Patterns

Glob `design/ux/*.md` (excluding `interaction-patterns.md`) and read the Component
Inventory and Interaction Map sections of each spec. Extract every interaction
pattern used.

Present the extracted list: "Based on existing UX specs, these patterns are already
in use in the game:"
- [Pattern name]: used in [screen], [screen]
- [etc.]

Ask: "Are there patterns you know exist but aren't in existing specs yet? List any
additional ones now."

---

#### Phase 2: Formalize Each Pattern

For each pattern (existing or new), document:

```markdown
### [Pattern Name]

**Category**: Navigation / Input / Feedback / Data Display / Modal / Overlay / [other]
**Used In**: [list of screens]

**Description**: [One paragraph explaining what this pattern is and when to use it]

**Specification**:
- [Component behavior]
- [Input mapping]
- [Visual/audio feedback]
- [Accessibility requirements for this pattern]

**When to Use**: [Conditions where this pattern is appropriate]
**When NOT to Use**: [Conditions where another pattern is more appropriate]

**Reference**: [Screenshot path or ASCII example, if available]
```

Work through patterns in groups. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "How do you want to work through these patterns?"
- Options: "Draft the first batch from existing specs (faster)", "Define them one by one (more control)", "Start with the most-used pattern first"

---

#### Phase 3: Identify Gaps

After cataloging known patterns, ask:
- "Are there screens or interactions planned that would need patterns not yet
  in this library?"
- "Are there any patterns in existing specs that feel inconsistent with each
  other and should be consolidated?"

Document gaps in the Gaps section for follow-up.
