# migrate-v1-config.sh — convert a v1.0 CCGS project to v1.1 `project.yaml`.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT SKILL PROSE
#
# "Migration on a real v1.0 project loses data" is the highest-severity risk in
# this whole area. Skill files are prose executed by a model and cannot be
# unit-tested, so a prose migration could not be proven correct before being
# pointed at someone's project. Every
# failure mode the spec names — malformed file, enum mismatch, split-brain,
# custom sections — is a testable branch here instead.
#
# Spec: `.claude/docs/effects-map.md` -> "Migration from v1.0 -> v1.1".
# That section is the authority. If this script and that section disagree, the
# section wins and this script is the bug.
#
# MODES
#   (default)   migrate: write project.yaml + production/migration-report.md
#   --dry-run   report what would happen; write nothing
#   --finalize  delete legacy files, but ONLY after proving their content is
#               preserved in project.yaml
#
# NON-DESTRUCTIVE BY DEFAULT. Migration leaves every legacy file in place, so
# the whole operation is reversible with `git checkout` until --finalize is run
# deliberately. That is why --finalize is a separate invocation and not a flag
# on the same run.
