# project-coherence.sh — compare what `project.yaml` DECLARES against what the
# project actually IS.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Three defects share one shape: `project.yaml` is treated as the source of truth
# and is never reconciled against the artifact it describes.
#
#   1  engine.version says 4.7.2; project.godot says 4.6; the binary is 4.6.1
#   2  engine.rendering says Forward+; project.godot says gl_compatibility
#   3  commands.build names an export preset with no export_presets.cfg
#
# The second is why this is a script and not another paragraph. `/setup-engine`
# ALREADY carries an emphatic, source-cited warning naming both of the exact
# mistakes that produce it ("Jolt is Godot's default 3D engine", "Forward+ is
# desktop-focused"). Prose is in place and does not hold on its own. What was
# missing was a step that reads back what was written.
#
# F1's root cause was subtler and is fixed elsewhere: `/setup-engine` is told to
# write an `Installed at pin time` row into VERSION.md, and no VERSION.md had
# such a row. There was no slot, so the step vanished leaving no trace. The row
# now ships in all three reference files, and check 1 below reads it.
#
# OBSERVATIONS, NEVER VERDICTS
#
# Per CLAUDE.md: a script that scores or judges will eventually contradict a mode
# or override it cannot see. This one prints what it compared and what it found,
# and always exits 0. The reader decides. A check that cannot run says so by
# name — silence is never treated as agreement.
