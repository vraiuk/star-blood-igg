#   1. cwd holds project.yaml   -> cwd   (a project root)
#   2. cwd holds .claude/       -> cwd   (a project root not yet configured)
#   3. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR       -> that  (populated in the hook environment)
#   4. this script's location   -> <root>/.claude/hooks/../.. by construction
# Rule 4 always works and needs no environment at all; rules 1-2 stop it from
# overriding a caller that legitimately means somewhere else.
#
# NOT an upward search: that resolves a nested project to its parent's config.

# `GIT_DIR=.git git commit`, a commit on a second line. Segments split on
# && || ; & | ( ) backticks and quotes, and on newlines. Before a segment's
# `git`, VAR=value words, `env`/`sudo`/`doas`/`xargs`/`nice`/`timeout` with
# their flags (a flag's value and timeout's duration included), shell keywords
# (`if`, `do`, `{`, `time`, ...) and a path, either slash (`/usr/bin/git`,
# `C:\Git\cmd\git.exe`) are allowed, and a QUOTED path to git ("C:\Program
# Files\Git\cmd\git.exe") is read as plain `git`; after it, git's own options
# (-C <dir>, -c <k=v>, --git-dir <dir> and the other long options that take a
# separate value, -p, --flag[=v]). A quoted value of git's own options --
# `-C "my repo"`, `--git-dir ".git"`, `-c user.name="A B"`, `--work-tree="."`,
# `-C "$(pwd)"` -- is unquoted first and its spaces and shell operators carried
# as \001, or the split cut `git` off from its subcommand and the commit went
# unchecked; an unquoted `$(pwd)` with no space in it is one word, too. Only
# when it follows `git`: a shell's own `bash -c "git commit"` was unquoted the
# same way, which glued the inner command into one word and skipped the check,
# and the quote after `=` in `grep "key=" f && git commit -m "x"` closes a
# string rather than opening a value. All splitting is awk: BSD sed writes a
# literal `n` for `\n`, so on macOS a sed split missed every chained form.
# Over-splitting only costs a check that finds nothing staged; under-splitting
# is the bypass. Kept identical in validate-push.sh.
#
# `git` itself is matched case-insensitively (`Git`, `GIT`) and a bare quoted
# `"git"` or `'git'` (no path) reads as plain `git` too, the same as a quoted
# path ending in it. `stdbuf`, `winpty` and `command -p` join `env`/`sudo`/...
# as prefixes that take flags. A line ending in a lone `\` is joined with the
# next before any of this runs, so `git \` then `commit` on the next line is
# still one command; `1<<y` inside `$((...))` is left-shift, not a here-doc
# opener, even though it matches `<<` the same as a real one. A quoted WORD
# with no shell-meaningful character inside it (a quoted branch name, `"main"`)
# is unquoted in place rather than read as a delimiter; a quoted string that
# DOES contain one is left for the here-doc/command handling above.
#
# A here-document body is text, not commands: a commit message, a file being
# written. Read as commands, a message quoting `git push origin main` warned
# about a push, and `cat > notes.md <<EOF` mentioning git commit blocked on
# staged data. So the body is dropped -- UNLESS its line runs an interpreter
# (bash <<EOF, python - <<EOF), whose here-doc IS commands: dropping that
# would be the bypass. `<<<` is a here-string, not a here-doc. An interpreter
# may carry a path (`/bin/bash <<EOF`). The delimiter is the whole word, or the
# whole quoted string (`<<'END-NOTES'`), and a `<<` inside a quoted string
# (`echo "a<<b"`) opens nothing -- `$(cat <<EOF` inside one still does. Either
# mistake left a here-doc that never closed and dropped every later line, a
# real commit included. A PowerShell single-quote here-string (`@'` ... `'@`)
# is the same kind of text and is dropped the same way; the double-quote form
# (`@"` ... `"@`) is left alone, because PowerShell itself expands `$(...)`
# inside it, and that content is still live.

# the hook exited 0: a check that could not run, reporting clean.
#
# So: try mktemp, then TMPDIR, then the repo own .git directory (writable by
# definition -- `git diff --cached` has already succeeded against it), and PROVE
# each candidate by writing to it. If none works, TMP_DESIGN stays empty and the

# BLOCKING CHECK FIRST. Everything below this block is advisory:
# it appends to $WARNINGS and the hook still exits 0. This block is the only one
# that can exit 2, and exit 2 is the entire reason the hook is registered.
#
# Running it THIRD, after the design-section scan, and validating one file
# per `python -m json.tool` invocation -- one interpreter spawn each, ~110ms on
# Windows -- gets the hook killed by its 15s timeout on a large commit before
# it reaches the corrupt file, so whether a bad file is caught depends on where
# its NAME SORTED. Measured with 201 staged files and one corrupt:
#
#   corrupt sorts FIRST -> 730ms,   rc=2,   BLOCKED emitted
#   corrupt sorts LAST  -> 15217ms, rc=124, nothing emitted, commit not blocked
#
# Two independent fixes, because either alone is a mitigation rather than a
# guarantee:
#   (a) ORDER. The blocking check runs before any advisory work, so a starved
#       hook has already done the part that matters.
#   (b) COST. One interpreter validates every staged JSON file, so the check is
#       constant in file count instead of linear. The one-subprocess-per-item
#       shape has caused this same starvation more than once; batching is the
#       only fix that holds.
#
# Making it merely faster is not enough -- the cost stays linear and the hook
# starves again at a larger file count. Batch it, or it returns.
#
# WHERE DATA LIVES is engine-specific, like the code root: Godot keeps it in
# assets/data/, Unity under Assets/ (Assets/Data/, Assets/Game/Data/), Unreal
# under Content/. Anchored to ^assets/data/ alone, this -- the hook's only
# blocking check -- never fired on Unity or Unreal. It stays inside the asset
# roots so an editor's JSON-with-comments (.vscode/settings.json) never blocks.

# Check for hardcoded gameplay values in gameplay code
# Uses grep -E (POSIX extended) instead of grep -P (Perl) for cross-platform compatibility
#
# Batched through xargs. Run one `grep` per staged file -- a process each,
# ~60ms on Windows -- and 400 staged gameplay files blow a 15s budget on their
# own. `xargs` packs as many
# paths into each grep as ARG_MAX allows, so the spawn count is bounded by total
# path length rather than by file count.
#
# `-l` not `-q`: with many files per invocation the exit status can no longer
# say WHICH matched, and the warning names the file. It stays a test, not a
# report -- `-l` prints only names, never matched lines, which is what the -q
# comment here was guarding against.
#
# NUL-delimited, NOT `-d '\n'`: both `-d` and `-r` are GNU-only extensions.
# BSD xargs (macOS) rejects `-d`, and because this pipeline ends in
# `2>/dev/null || true` the rejection is SILENT -- the check returns empty and
# reports nothing found, which is indistinguishable from a clean scan. README
# claims these hooks run on macOS, so a silent no-op there is a false pass.
# `-0` exists in both GNU and BSD xargs. `-r` is dropped, not replaced: both
# callers below reach xargs only inside `if [ -n ... ]`, so the empty-input case
# it guarded cannot occur. `|| true` stays -- grep exits 1 on no match, which is
# the normal case and not an error.
# --- resolve the code root before either scan below ------------------------
#
# Both scans used to be hardcoded to `^src/gameplay/` and `^src/`. Per
# .claude/docs/directory-structure.md, `src/` is the GODOT row of the code-root
# table -- Unity compiles only `Assets/`, Unreal builds only from `Source/`. So
# on two of the three supported engines both greps matched nothing on every
# commit, both checks silently did not run, and the hook exited 0. A scan that
# cannot run and a scan that found nothing produced the identical artifact.
#
# The `/gameplay/` narrowing is dropped rather than translated: it describes a
# Godot source layout and has no Unity or Unreal equivalent, so keeping it would
# leave the check Godot-only by a second route. The hardcoded-value scan instead
# widens to the whole code root and is bounded by source-code EXTENSION, which
# is what actually keeps it precise -- without it, a Unity commit would drag
# `.meta`, `.asset` and `.prefab` YAML (all full of `speed: 5`) into a scan
# meant for code, and a hook that cries wolf gets muted rather than fixed.
